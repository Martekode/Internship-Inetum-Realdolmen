# LOGBOOK
Here I'll be noting my progress from each day or my lack of progress if that would be the case. This is so you can follow along with my journey. 

## LOG
### 14/11
picked up my material in Huizingen and traveled back to Gent via train. This took me quite a bit. After that i reasearched a bit about PWA's. This is where I found out about workbox.
### 15/11
Went to office in Gent to check it out. Started with the documentation of workbox and specifically Service workers. I'm researching the theory about them so that I could understand them more and what their capabilities are. I also worked onthe setup of my computer: git, microsoft sql server, ...
documented lifecylce of the SW and the updates of the SW. Also researched a bit about cache strategies. 
### 16/11
researched about the working of workbox from the docs. Spent the majority on refactoring my repo structure and readme structure. It was all in one file. This was hard to read so i seperated everything and made a navigation.
### 17/11
finished up the research from the docs. Started research around using workbox react. I might want to look into angular compatability sinds it's not supported by the workbox team. Might be fun to find out.
### 18/11
today i started again with researching about workbox and react compatibility. After that i started on researching into angular with service workers. I'm not done with this sinds it's not as straightforward.
### 21/11 
Today I'll be working on the research further of angular. I'll write down some steps and provide the resource.
