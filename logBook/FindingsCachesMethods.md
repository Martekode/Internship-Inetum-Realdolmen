# How can i access the data inside the service worker cache?

To access the data inside the service worker cache, you can use the Cache interface provided by the CacheStorage interface. The Cache interface provides methods for storing and retrieving responses, as well as for deleting and querying for entries in the cache.

Here is an example of how you can use the Cache interface to access the data inside the service worker cache:

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.open('my-cache').then(cache => {
      return cache.match(event.request).then(response => {
        // If the request is in the cache, return the cached response.
        // Otherwise, fetch the request and add it to the cache.
        return response || fetch(event.request).then(response => {
          cache.put(event.request, response.clone());
          return response;
        });
      });
    })
  );
});
```

In this example, the fetch event listener opens the cache with the name 'my-cache' and uses the match() method to search for a cached response that matches the request. If a match is found, it is returned. If no match is found, the request is fetched and the response is added to the cache using the put() method.

You can also use the keys() method to get a list of all the request objects stored in the cache, and the delete() method to delete specific entries from the cache.

# when i use catch.match i get a promise without the data. How do i get the data itself?

The Cache.match() method returns a promise that resolves to a Response object containing the cached response, or undefined if the cache doesn't contain a matching response. To get the data from the response, you can use the Response.text() or Response.json() method to retrieve the response body as a string or JSON object, respectively.

Here's an example of how you can use the Response.json() method to get the data from a cached response:

```js
caches.open('my-cache').then(cache => {
  return cache.match('/data/info.json').then(response => {
    if (response) {
      return response.json().then(data => {
        // Do something with the data
      });
    }
  });
});
```
Alternatively, you can use the Response.blob() method to get the response body as a Blob, or the Response.arrayBuffer() method to get the response body as an ArrayBuffer.
