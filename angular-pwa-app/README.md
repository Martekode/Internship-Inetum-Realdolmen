# Angular PWA app 
i test the caching capabilities of the PWA. right now the application pulls a pokemon from the POKEAPI and displayes the name and the ID. When the application is offline or the api is offline or the user doesn't have any internet, the application is going to serve you the cached pokemon. right now it is straightforward and barebones but it is to test it out. after this ill start working on my own database and api to fetch from.
