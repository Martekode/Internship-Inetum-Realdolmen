# Framework
Everything we diiscussed up until this point had no framework in mind. Many framworks have there implementations of wordbox. For example `create-react-app` comes with workbox shipped in by default. Some of these implementations of workbox by frameworks may restrict you in configurations. If that happens you can always fall back to vanilla. 

## react/react-compatible
- [`create-react-app`](https://web.dev/precache-with-workbox-react/)
- `gatsby-plugin-offline`
